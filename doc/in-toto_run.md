## in-toto run

Executes the passed command and records paths and hashes of 'materials'

### Synopsis

Executes the passed command and records paths and hashes of 'materials' (i.e.
files before command execution) and 'products' (i.e. files after command
execution) and stores them together with other information (executed command,
return value, stdout, stderr, ...) to a link metadata file, which is signed
with the passed key.  Returns nonzero value on failure and zero otherwise.

### Options

```
  -c, --cert string                 Path to a PEM formatted certificate that corresponds with
                                    the provided key.
  -e, --exclude stringArray         Path patterns to match paths that should not be recorded as 0
                                    ‘materials’ or ‘products’. Passed patterns override patterns defined
                                    in environment variables or config files. See Config docs for details.
  -h, --help                        help for run
  -k, --key string                  Path to a PEM formatted private key file used to sign
                                    the resulting link metadata.
  -l, --lstrip-paths stringArray    Path prefixes used to left-strip artifact paths before storing
                                    them to the resulting link metadata. If multiple prefixes
                                    are specified, only a single prefix can match the path of
                                    any artifact and that is then left-stripped. All prefixes
                                    are checked to ensure none of them are a left substring
                                    of another.
  -m, --materials stringArray       Paths to files or directories, whose paths and hashes
                                    are stored in the resulting link metadata before the
                                    command is executed. Symlinks are followed.
  -d, --metadata-directory string   Directory to store link metadata (default "./")
  -n, --name string                 Name used to associate the resulting link metadata
                                    with the corresponding step defined in an in-toto layout.
  -p, --products stringArray        Paths to files or directories, whose paths and hashes
                                    are stored in the resulting link metadata after the
                                    command is executed. Symlinks are followed.
  -r, --run-dir string              runDir specifies the working directory of the command.
                                    If runDir is the empty string, the command will run in the
                                    calling process's current directory. The runDir directory must
                                    exist, be writable, and not be a symlink.
      --use-dsse                    blabla
